The goal of the research is to investigate Fusarium community composition and diversity within different diseased wheat heads in the field. The diseased wheat heads were sampled from 26 intensive wheat-growing regions in China. FHB-heads were individually extracted for its total DNA that was used for PCR amplification with a newly developed pair of TEF1 primers, TEF1-Illf and TEF1-Illr. With Illumina paired-end sequencing and the new TEF1 pair of primers, the partial sequence (~470 bp) of the single-copy TEF1 gene was used to identify different Fusarium species. This script was used to classify different Fusarium OTUs according to different sampling sites and different diseased wheat heads.

Sequencing reads of samples from different diseased wheat heads (TEF reads) have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) of National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under the BioProject accession number, PRJNA789709.
